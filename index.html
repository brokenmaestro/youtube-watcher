  Hi Friends
    
  This week I wanted to share my thoughts on the signal app debacle.
    
  Pete Hegseth, the United States Secretary of Defense, is shouldering the lion share of the blame about a journalist being added to a sensitive conversation about war plans that were coming up soon a short time before the mission. 
    
  Recorded at the Robinson Center in Little Rock, AR

              <p><strong>@Afrokid </strong> About 30 minutes ago I literally just caught my husband of 9 years trying to meet up with a random woman to cheat. I will be devastated when this hits me but for the next 36 minutes i know ill be ok. Thank you Josh you have no idea what you do for us!!! We can never even begin to repay you!!!</p>
              <p><strong>@GianmarcoSoresi </strong>I must say as a woman I had no idea people were so petty in their phone contact names! </p>
              <p><strong>@MarcFisher87 </strong>I'm glad Josh brought up the morality of bombing Yemen. That's what I've been thinking about since the story came out and I wish someone would call them out on that. </p>
              <p><strong>@Aribelledream59 </strong>Correct.  "This is your sister's wedding, and you WILL support her!" means the person who messaged Josh was the father of the bride and the father of the person Josh was pretending to be.  That's going to be a VERY serious conversation later on.  I hope Josh puts it in his next routine as a follow-up.</p>
              <p><strong>@woodenhornets </strong>Unrelated, but the fact that Comedians and Commentators and Creatives,  Individuals , are my go-to sources of news and info regarding current events, and not the news (papers, channels, sites, etc), is absolutely telling of the kind of capitalist police state we live in.</p>
              <p><strong>@fisharefriendsnotfood65 </strong>Part of Josh's appeal is that he's a late millennial who already gives Unc energy.</p>
              <p><strong>@CourtneyMiller </strong>My brother is Navy ATC. At the beginning of March he said that Houthis tried attacking us off the Yemeni Coast in the Meditterranean (to which we responded with, you know, a bombing). My brother is assigned to one of the ships out there (he's not there now, but will be when it returns to Norfolk and leaves again). Idk how to describe the visceral terror I felt realizing that the attack my brother described weeks before this broke was the subject of this Signal situation. And the strange feeling of connecting those dots.</p>
              <p><strong>@JackobWisocki </strong>Very insightful commentary on the absurdity of the modern US government</p>
